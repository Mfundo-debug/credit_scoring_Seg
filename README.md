# Credit Scoring and Segmentation

-   [x] Credit scoring is a statistical analysis performed by lenders and financial institutions to access a person's creditworthiness. Lenders use credit scoring, among other things, to decide on whether to extend or deny credit.

-   [x] Credit Segmentation refers to the process of dividing the customers into groups based on their credit behavior. The customers are divided into different segments based on their credit score, credit history, and other factors.

-   [x] The goal of this project is to segment customers into different groups based on their credit behavior.

-   [x] You can access the dataset via this link here https://statso.io/credit-scoring-case-study/ or you can download it from the data folder in this repository.

#### Overview

Credit scoring aims to determine the creditworthiness of individuals based on their credit profiles. By analyzing factors such as payment history, credit utilization ratio, and number of credit accounts, we can assign a credit score to each individual, providing a quantitative measure of their creditworthiness.

The given dataset includes features such as age, gender, marital status, education level, employment status, credit utilization ratio, payment history, number of credit accounts, loan amount, interest rate, loan term, type of loan, and income level.

Your task is to calculate credit scores and segment customers based on their credit scores to gain insights into different customer groups.

#### Make sure the following libraries for this project

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import os
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score,confusion_matrix,classification_report
```

Alternatively you cn use the requirements.txt file to install all the libraries used in this project.

```{python}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### FICO Formula

let p be payment history

let C be Credit Utilization Ration

let n be Number of Credit Accounts

let el be Education Level

let es be Employment Status

and it can be demonstrated mathematical wise and also in python code:

$$
FICO = (0.35p) + (0.3C) + (0.15n) + (0.1el) + (0.1es)
$$

```{python}
credit_score = (payment_history*0.35) + (credit_utilization_ratio*0.3) + (number_of_credit_accounts*0.15) + (education_level*0.1) + (employment_status*0.1)
credit_scores.append(credit_score)
```

### Description of all features in the data:

1.  Age: represents the age of the customer
2.  Gender: represents gender of the customer
3.  Marital status: represents whether the customer is married or single
4.  Education level: represents the education level of the customer
5.  Employment status: represents whether the customer is employed or unemployed
