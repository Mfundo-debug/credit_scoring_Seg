#### Overview

Credit scoring aims to determine the creditworthiness of individuals based on their credit profiles. By analyzing factors such as payment history, credit utilization ratio, and number of credit accounts, we can assign a credit score to each individual, providing a quantitative measure of their creditworthiness.

The given dataset includes features such as age, gender, marital status, education level, employment status, credit utilization ratio, payment history, number of credit accounts, loan amount, interest rate, loan term, type of loan, and income level.

Your task is to calculate credit scores and segment customers based on their credit scores to gain insights into different customer groups.
